		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<hr>
		<img id="headshot" src="assets/images/headshot.jpg">
		<p>I am currently attending the UM Coding Bootcamp with aspirations to become the <strong>best</strong> MERN-stack web developer in the business. I am also a math tutor and a scuba instructor. I am 26 years old and have lived my whole life in south Florida. I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Miami.</p>

		<p>My biggest passion is the ocean; I have logged more than a thousand dives and enjoy spearfishing and diving with sharks in particular. Other hobbies of mine include playing saxophone, playing board games playing racquetball, and cooking.</p>

		<p>I attribute a lot of my recent success to Dave Asprey's <a href="https://www.bulletproof.com/">Bulletproof Diet</a>, a ketogenic diet that I started in the beginning of January 2018. On this diet, my mental performance is fantastic compared to before, I eat delicious food, I never feel hungry or tired, and I am losing weight.</p>
